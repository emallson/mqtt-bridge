# mqtt-bridge

This is a small Node application to link one MQTT broker to another.
The idea is that we can use this to link a local Edge MQTT-SN broker
to a cloud-based MQTT broker. Then, local devices need only know about
the local broker and cloud applications about the cloud broker.

## Scope

This application is just for a project in a course, and will not be
maintained past the end of the Fall 2016 semester. Feel free to fork
and extend.
